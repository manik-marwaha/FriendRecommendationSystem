# FriendRecommendationSystem

IN THIS REPOSITORY I HAVE IMPLEMETED THE FRIEND RECOMMENDATION IN JAVA

Using MapReduce in Hadoop I implemented a simple People You Might Know social network friendship recommendation algorithm. 
The key ideais that if two people have a lot of mutual friends, then the system should reccommend that they connect with each other.
The input file contains the adjacency list and has multiple lines



The  output  should  contain  one  line  per  user  in  the  following  format:
<User><TAB><Recommendations>
